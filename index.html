              I'm Jeff Nettleton &mdash; a programmer, a coder, a tinkerer, and
              one incredibly interested person. I live in <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."> Washington, D.C.
              </a>, although I hail from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">
              southern California</a>. I read things that help me think through
              doing things that help me learn. I write code that does stuff,
              like taking a lot of data and turning it into a beautiful, functional
              visualization, or re-thinking the way that public records access
              can be used to bring about positive change. My passion lies at the
              intersection of technology and public policy. I also love books 
              and cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early in my programming career, I worked with a great deal of C,
              C++, and C# writing low-level systems applications, such as
              integrating sensor devices with a data collection and reporting
              suite. In the last few years, however, I have begun writing quite
              a bit more frequently in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>,
              not only as a great language for data analysis and processing, but also
              as a web service and application backend language, complemented by
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">
              Javascript</a> and HTML5/CSS3 on the frontend. If I had to pick a
              current favorite full-service web stack, it would be <a 
              href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> (Python 3.4) on the server,
              with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> on the client
              side in a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> web framework
              with abundant <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a> for visualizations
              of many kinds. Although I've worked on Windows both professionally
              and personally for many years, I much prefer working in the *nix 
              style environments, with <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch
              Linux</a> being my favorite. I code in <a href="http://www.vim.org">
              ViM</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's all I have for now. Soon, there will be more &mdash; my
              thoughts on how to do great things with code and do great things
              for people, my opinions on things that happen, books that make more
              things make more sense, and recipes to make things taste good.
